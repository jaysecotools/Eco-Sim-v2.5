## [2.0.0] - 2024-06-20
### Added
- **Lotka-Volterra predator-prey dynamics**
  - Prey growth rate (Î±): 0.04
  - Predation rate (Î²): 0.03
  - Predator death rate (Î³): 0.02
  - Energy conversion efficiency (Î´): 0.3

- **Genetic trait system**
  - Predator traits: speed (1-10), aggression (1-10), size (1-5)
  - Prey traits: speed (1-10), camouflage (1-10), fertility (1-5)
  - 5% mutation chance during reproduction

- **Environmental systems**
  - Seasonal cycle (spring/summer/autumn/winter) affecting:
    - Carrying capacity (Â±30%)
    - Trait effectiveness
  - Random disasters (1% daily chance):
    - Drought: reduces plants, increases predator aggression
    - Flood: population reduction
    - Disease: targets dominant species

### Changed
- **Population dynamics**
  - Implemented carrying capacity limits
  - Added phase space visualization
  - Enhanced chart tooltips with trait data

- **UI improvements**
  - New organism inspection panel
  - Real-time trait distribution charts
  - Disaster alert system

### Fixed
- Stabilized simulation balance
- Prevented population crashes
- Improved performance with 500+ entities
